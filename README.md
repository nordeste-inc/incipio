# incipio ðŸ’«

`incipio` is a (WIP) lightweight init system for Linux-based operating systems.

# Tenets

* should not be arcane: code must be understandable and well documented
* must have robust error treatment
* must be lightweight on memory
    *  as a `no-std` Rust program, aims to not make any heap allocations
* must be quick
* must be simple
